# Machine Learning Specialization 

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the "Machine Learning Specialization" by deeplearning.AI on Coursera. This specialization consists of three comprehensive courses, each designed to provide a strong foundation in machine learning concepts and practical skills using Python and popular libraries.

## Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

In this course, you will learn the essentials of supervised machine learning, focusing on regression and classification tasks. The course is divided into the following modules:

- **Module 1: Intro to Machine Learning**
  - Gain a solid understanding of machine learning fundamentals and its applications.

- **Module 2: Regression with Multiple Input Variables**
  - Learn about linear regression with multiple input variables, a crucial technique for prediction tasks.

- **Module 3: Classification**
  - Dive into binary classification using logistic regression, another key technique for classification tasks.

## Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms

The second course covers a broad range of modern machine learning techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as best practices. The modules include:

- **Module 1: Neural Networks**
  - Introduction to neural networks, including concepts and architectures.

- **Module 2: Neural Networks Training**
  - Learn the process of training neural networks, an essential skill for deep learning.

- **Module 3: Advice for Applying Machine Learning**
  - Gain insights into practical aspects of applying machine learning in real-world scenarios.

- **Module 4: Decision Trees**
  - Understand decision trees and their role in machine learning workflows.

## Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

The final course explores unsupervised learning, recommendation systems, and reinforcement learning. The modules include:

- **Module 1: Unsupervised Learning**
  - Learn about clustering and anomaly detection, two key unsupervised learning techniques.

- **Module 2: Recommender System**
  - Build recommender systems using collaborative filtering and deep learning approaches.

- **Module 3: Reinforcement Learning**
  - Explore reinforcement learning and its applications, including deep reinforcement learning.

By completing this specialization, you will have a solid theoretical foundation and practical experience in key machine learning concepts. This knowledge equips you to tackle complex real-world challenges using machine learning techniques.
